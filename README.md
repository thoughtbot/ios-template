A template for new iOS projects at thoughtbot.

Inspired by [suspenders], and [django-template].

[suspenders]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders
[django-template]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/django-template

## What's in the template?

 - Up to date with the latest release of Xcode and Swift
 - Uses [Carthage] for dependency management
  - Helper `bin` scripts for working with Carthage
  - Fails fast when dependencies are out of date
 - [Default dependencies for testing][testing-deps]
 - [Default dependencies for production][production-deps]
 - Configuration for [CircleCI]

[Carthage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage
[testing-deps]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/kickoff-ios/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Cartfile.private
[production-deps]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/kickoff-ios/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Cartfile
[CircleCI]: https://circleci.com

## Usage

1. [Install cookiecutter][cookiecutter] (`brew install cookiecutter` on

2. Run `cookiecutter gh:thoughtbot/kickoff-ios`

[cookiecutter]: http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html

For future runs you can shorten the command to `cookiecutter kickoff-ios`.
However, if you want to use the most recent template you should still run the
full command above.
